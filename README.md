# AI Problem-Solving with Exercises Inspired by *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*

## Description

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering concepts from **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA)** through hands-on exercises and mini-projects. Each chapter introduces key AI techniques which are reinforced with practical problem-solving exercises. The goal is to solve exercises in a structured, incremental way to develop a deep understanding of AI by implementing solutions to challenges inspired by the book.

The repository includes:

- **Chapter-based exercises**: Focused problems from core AI domains like search, logic, and planning
- **Mini-projects**: Practical applications of algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as game-playing agents.
- **Theoretical insights**: A synthesis of key concepts from each chapter to bridge theory and practice.
